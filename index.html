                I gaze at<br>
                the end of the decayed scent<br>
                The curled petals<br>
                are silent<br>
                The dust under the flashlight<br>
                freezes grayly<br>
                Quietly mocking at our transiency<br><br>
                Why can’t it stay forever?<br><br>
                Is it that it’s as brittle as<br>
                the flame?<br>
                Is it that its coldness cannot hold<br>
                its destiny?<br><br>
                If everything flow like water<br>
                If everything flow like flame<br>
                Then why I have to<br>
                be contrary to you?<br>
                Why there’s always falling<br>
                behind love?<br><br>
                The burning is in vain<br>
                The memories are in vain<br>
                The flushing is in vain<br>
                And the ashes are in vain<br><br>
                Maybe only in vanity<br>
                I can hold you by<br>
            </div>
            <div id="sound">
                Thump, rustle, patter. Which one is more like<br>
                The sound of my heartbeat when I’m with you?<br>
                The flapping wings of the butterfly in my stomach became slight<br>
                Covered by the bubble burst when you are leaving my view<br>
                When wind is the only one that touches my hair, I wonder<br>
                At which moment do we have the shortest distance<br>
                Is that when our ID cards lay in your pocket together?<br>
                Or when we stared at the rising tide as it held our reminiscence?<br>
                Sometimes, I think it might be better for me to leave you<br>
                Because your charm and selfishness occupy all my mind<br>
                So that I would forget myself even when I’m turning blue<br>
                And only remember the gurgle when you pour the wine<br>
                When I can no longer afford the cost of your kiss goodnight<br>
                The only thing I can do is to depict you when I can still write<br>
            </div>
            <div id="whispered">
                You exist in the moonlight that looks like ocean<br>
                And exist in the moonlight that feels like prison<br>
                The lily white scar on my arm comes from you<br>
                The butterfly that died in my stomach comes from you<br><br>
                You exist in the moonlight that screams quietly<br>
                And exist in the moonlight that illuminates the suffocating fish<br>
                The mole that slowly solidifies on my face comes from you<br>
                The rain I dreamed of or the rain that actually existed comes from you<br><br>
                You are an eternal epic<br>
                or a summer night with an expiration date<br>
                You don't belong to me or anyone,<br>
                or anything, or any time frame<br>
                I can’t keep you or hide from you<br><br>
                But just like I don't belong to the drop<br>
                that fall from bird feathers anymore<br>
                I decided to save you in tears<br>
                and not to write about you anymore<br>

            <div id="goodbye">
                Maybe there shouldn't be a goodbye in this poem<br>
                But I want to &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp say goodbye to your trembling loneliness<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp burning sinking<br>
                Escape to a new dream!<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A dream belonged to the morning mist<br>
                and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp using the evening singing<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to dissolve &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the endless rain<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and the concretionary hesitation<br><br><br>
                Maybe there shouldn't be a goodbye in this poem<br>
            </div>
            <div id="particles">
                When the faded summer<br>
                leaves, I<br>
                feel you<br>
                in the invisible breeze<br><br>
                The floating particles<br>
                follow you<br>
                and leave hazy marks<br>
                on our skin<br><br><br>
                After dusk,<br>
                you bring me a<br>
                salmon-colored<br>
                burning blaze<br><br>
                I lean down<br>
                seeing the particles<br>
                that linger by the flame<br>
                as the perpetual sun<br>
            </div>
            <div id="cig">
                The serpentine flame gradually disperses<br>
                so I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (have to)<br>

                The fallen light ripples on the river<br>
                one &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp after another<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp one<br><br>
                I am watching you &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp so I forget to say<br>
                how I like the corrupting red<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp leaning on the brutal blue<br>
                – though I’ve been keep talking,<br>
                but just because I don't want to<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp live in the emptiness again<br><br>
                The smoke gets bigger and bigger &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and also<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp disappears<br>
                just like every other matters<br>
                Tonight &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp except for the land we step<br>
                we didn’t &nbsp&nbsp (and don’t dare to)<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp touch anything else &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp besides our cig<br><br>
                The whole world<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp is fading away slowly<br>
                I think:<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the moon is no longer the moon<br>
                I think:<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp maybe no one can escape from the moon<br>
